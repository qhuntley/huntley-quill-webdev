Quill Huntley
Web Development, Summer 1 2017

My name is Quill Huntley and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and English, with a minor in Journalism. In my freshman year, I took Intro to Web Development and during my first co-op I did some Web Development work. Besides this, I have had very little experience, but am excited to learn more! I am not currently working on any projects, but hope to bring the knowledge I learn here to my second co-op, working as part of a User Experience team. This repository is intended for my work during Web Development Summer 1 2017.</p>
